# Cerebrum

In Bangladesh and in outer world, one of the biggest problem is mental health issue. Nearly one in five U.S. adults lives with a mental illness (44.7 million in 2016). Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. Two broad categories can be used to describe these conditions: Any Mental Illness (AMI) and Serious Mental Illness (SMI). AMI encompasses all recognized mental illnesses.
The wide variety of anxiety disorders differ by the objects or situations that induce them, but share features of excessive anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Anxiety disorders can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships.
Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by dramatic shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that are experienced by everyone.
These are some mental disorders I have mentioned about. There are more of problems people are facing now-a-days. These problems can collapse a man’s social life, work and family life. This is why I took a small initiative to make this online system as people, especially those who cannot visit a doctor because of this society’s social stigma, can seek help from “Cerebrum”.
